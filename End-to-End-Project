What is SonarCloud?
SonarCloud is a cloud-based code quality and security service. It provides continuous inspection of code quality to detect bugs, 
vulnerabilities, and code smells in projects. It supports various programming languages and integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create account in sonar cloud (https://sonarcloud.io/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
write jenkins pipeline code for analyzing the code :-

pipeline {
  agent any
  tools { 
        maven 'Maven_3_5_2'  
    }
   stages{
    stage('CompileandRunSonarAnalysis') {
            steps {	
		sh 'mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=asgbuggywebapp -Dsonar.organization=asgbuggywebapp -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io -Dsonar.token=9325586a8f1d1adf470b908a46156f5844'
			}
        } 
  }
}

Create a new organization project and define key , organization name and generate a token then update in the above pipeline

Create a pipeline in jenkins and select jenkins file from SCM 
provide github URL where our jenkins file and project is there
make sure correct branch(main or master)
save project and built it.

What SCA in DevSecOps ?
In DevSecOps, SCA stands for Software Composition Analysis. It's a security practice that focuses on identifying and managing risks associated with third-party and open source components used in software development. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Identification:** SCA tools identify all third-party components and libraries used in an application, including their versions.

2. **Vulnerability Detection:** They scan these components for known security vulnerabilities and provide reports on any risks found.

3. **License Compliance:** SCA tools also check for license compliance issues to ensure that organizations are using open source software in accordance with legal requirements.

4. **Integration:** SCA is integrated into the DevOps pipeline to automate checks during build and deployment processes, ensuring continuous monitoring and proactive risk management.

Overall, SCA in DevSecOps helps teams ensure the security, compliance, and integrity of their software by addressing risks associated with third-party software components early in the development lifecycle.
